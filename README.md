This project implements four CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Shortest-Remaining-Time (SRT), and Round Robin (RR). The program allows users to select a scheduling algorithm, input process details, and view the Gantt chart, waiting times, turnaround times, and average statistics.

It is written in C++, using vectors, queues, and sorting functions to efficiently manage process execution. The project demonstrates the differences in scheduling strategies and their impact on system performance.
